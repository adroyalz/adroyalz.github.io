<h2 id="h2">History of flutes</h2>

<p>The flute is one of the oldest musical instruments of all and is regarded as the first ever wind instrument. It has been in use at least since the Stone Age.</p>

<p>
Flute playing has a particularly long tradition in the Orient. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer"> Sumerians </a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptians">Egyptians</a> were among the first to add three or four finger-holes to their bamboo flutes, which enabled them to produce several notes.</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece"> Ancient Greeks</a> also had quite sophisticated flutes, which were blown at the open upper end and had six finger-holes. However, the flute was regarded as an instrument of the common man and as such was held in scant regard. In contrast, the aulos , a distant precursor of the oboe, was always associated with high social standing.</p>

<p>
The flutes used in today’s orchestras are transverse flutes, as opposed to the Greeks’ end-blown flutes and the (modern) recorder. The first evidence of the use of transverse flutes in Europe comes from Etruscan iconographs from the 4th to the 1st centuries BC. Side-blown flutes were also known to the Romans.</p>
